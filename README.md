# Hotel-Cancellation-Analytics-Dashboard
I have developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data collection, data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data from City and Resort Hotels to identify the major reasons behind booking cancellations. The insights will help hotel management design data-driven strategies to reduce cancellations and optimize room occupancy in the coming years.

Dataset Used:
Dataset: Hotel Booking Dataset (2015–2022)
Source: Internal hotel booking records
The dataset includes information such as hotel type, booking status, customer demographics, lead time, room type, booking channels, and reservation details.
________________________________________
Questions (KPIs):
1.	Compare confirmed vs. cancelled bookings.
2.	Which month records the highest number of cancellations?
3.	What is the cancellation rate by hotel type (City vs. Resort)?
4.	What is the average lead time for cancelled vs. successful bookings?
5.	Which countries contribute the most bookings?
6.	How does guest type (Single, Couples, Family) relate to cancellation trends?
7.	What is the distribution of reservation statuses (Check-Out, Cancelled, No-Show)?
8.	Which room status (Desired/Un-Desired) is more common?
9.	What percentage of total bookings were successfully checked out?
10.	Key demographic or behavioral insights that can help reduce cancellations.

Process:
1.	Data Cleaning & Validation:
o	Removed missing or duplicate entries.
o	Ensured consistent formatting for hotel names, months, and status fields.
o	Handled missing country and children values with imputation or removal.
2.	Data Analysis:
o	Created Pivot Tables for each KPI.
o	Used Pivot Charts to visualize booking vs. cancellation trends, hotel comparisons, and monthly variations.
o	Added calculated fields to compute average lead times and percentages.
3.	Dashboard Creation:
o	Combined all visuals into an interactive Excel dashboard.
o	Added slicers for Hotel Type, Month, and Guest Type for dynamic filtering.
o	Included KPIs showing total bookings, cancellation rate, and average lead time.

Project Insights:
•	Overall cancellation rate: ~37%.
•	City Hotels experience higher cancellations (~42%) compared to Resort Hotels (~28%).
•	August, July, and May record the highest cancellation volumes.
•	Average lead time for cancelled bookings is 145 days, compared to 80 days for successful ones — suggesting that early bookers are more likely to cancel.
•	Top 5 countries by bookings: Portugal (PRT), UK (GBR), France (FRA), Spain (ESP), and Germany (DEU).
•	Couples form the largest guest group and show the highest cancellation rate (~40%).
•	87% of rooms are categorized as “Desired”, indicating strong room allocation efficiency.
•	62.9% of total reservations resulted in successful check-outs, while 36% were cancelled.

Final Conclusion:
To minimize booking cancellations and improve customer retention, hotels should focus on:
•	Introducing flexible cancellation policies for long lead-time bookings.
•	Targeting couple travelers with loyalty programs and incentives.
•	Using predictive analytics to forecast cancellations based on booking behavior.
•	Monitoring City Hotel performance closely and revising pricing strategies.
•	Strengthening communication with customers who book far in advance to reduce uncertainty.
By acting on these insights, hotel management can achieve higher occupancy, better revenue management, and stronger customer satisfaction.
